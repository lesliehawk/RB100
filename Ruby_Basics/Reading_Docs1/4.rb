# In the previous exercise, you learned that 
# the while loop returns nil unless break is used. 
# Locate the documentation for break, 
# and determine what value break sets the return value to 
# for the while loop.

# break accepts a value that supplies the result 
# of the expression it is “breaking” out of

# LS note:
# the while loop documentation says that while returns nil 
# unless break receives a value. 
# So, if break is not supplied a value, while still returns nil.

# Using the Ruby documentation, 
# determine how you would write a Symbol that represents your name. 
# We aren't looking for a String; 
# we want a Symbol, which is one of Ruby's datatypes.

# You may reference a symbol using a colon: :my_symbol.

:Leslie #Symbol literal

# or create one while assigning it to a variable
name = :Leslie
